# Accelerator Framework 1

This is my first version of my fps framework known as Accelerator Framework.
I made this when I was 13 and had like maybe 1.5 years of experience, not knowing a lot about OOP.
It's definitely not at all recomended to be used in-game.

I spent the whole month of May during Summer holiday making this, every single day.
13 yr old me **grinded**!!
